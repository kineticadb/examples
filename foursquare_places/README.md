<h1>
Analyzing Foursquare OS Places With Kinetica-Graph
</h1>

This workbook shows how Kinetica-Graph can be used to efficiently computes batch isochrones (travel time zones) over road networks using a single SQL statement. The key focus is on scalability and competitive coverage analysis for applications like fire station response times and business location optimization.

Instead of relying on geodesic distance, Kinetica-Graph's isochrone computation uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm on road network topology, ensuring travel times reflect real-world routes and conditions. These computations can help businesses analyze customer reach and competitive overlap.

For real-world business use cases, the solver can invert graph directionality, finding which locations can reach a business within a given time rather than the other way around.
