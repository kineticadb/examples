This is a really simple demo that solves a challenging problem. The steps broadly are the following.\n1. Plug into streaming and static data sources and load the data into relational tables in Kinetica\n2. Setup a continuously updated risk monitoring view that combines portfolio holdings data with real time stock prices\n3. Setup up alerts via webhooks and/or sink the data to a Kafka topic\nAll of this is done with just a few simple SQL statements and relational tables.","user_id":"9c760bc0-b6f8-11ed-93a5-3f0b17e09293","warehouse_id":null,"is_example":false,"is_shared":false,"created_at":"2022-03-02T19:44:09.007Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T13:58:44.263Z","userId":"9c760bc0-b6f8-11ed-93a5-3f0b17e09293"},"worksheets":[{"config":{},"id":"03aef050-b770-11ed-96c1-b3b0c8482874","name":"1.
