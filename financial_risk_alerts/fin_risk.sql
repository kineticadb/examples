/* Workbook: Real-Time Financial Risk */
/* Workbook Description: In this demo, we set up a real-time risk monitoring system with Kinetica that alerts investors as and when portfolio values fall below certain thresholds. This is a really simple demo that solves a challenging problem. The steps broadly are the following.
1. Plug into streaming and static data sources and load the data into relational tables in Kinetica
2. Setup a continuously updated risk monitoring view that combines portfolio holdings data with real time stock prices
3. Setup up alerts via webhooks and/or sink the data to a Kafka topic
All of this is done with just a few simple SQL statements and relational tables. */

PEEKING REAL-TIME INTO THE WORLD'S TOP INVESTORS
Many of the world's storied investors are Hedge Funds. Unlike mutual funds, to which most people have access to, hedge funds cater to institutions and wealthy investors. Fortunately, four times a year, we get a peek into this secretive world by way of regulatory filings. Hedge funds holdings give us a unique view into their thinking c/o the bets they are making.
While holdings are published only quarterly, we have real-time information on the value of their known holdings -- so we can walk-forward the value of their holdings. This has traditionally been an academic curiosity, but with recent hedge fund blow-ups, this is now a practical exercise as well.
In this demo, we show how Kinetica can be used to set up a risk monitoring system that automatically triggers alerts based on shifts in portfolio values.

DATASETS
We will be using three datasets to drive our optimizations:
Two are static files, both hosted in an S3 bucket on AWS:
- SEC 13-F filings (up to Q1 - 2021)
- End of day price file (for Jan-29th, 2021)
The final dataset is a 24-7 real-time stream of real exchange prices that simulates market movements. This is available as a Kafka topic that can be consumed directly from Confluent Cloud.

/*
THE STEPS FOR LOADING DATA
The process for ingesting data from remote data sources is listed below. The first two steps are optional but recommended.
1. Create a Schema (Optional): Schemas are containers for tables and other database objects that provide a unique namespace within them. Tables that are created without a schema specified will be placed in the default schema
ki_home
.
2. Create the table (Optional): Kinetica has a robust type inferencing system that can infer column specifications as the data is being ingested. If you skip this step, Kinetica will infer the types and create the table when the data is being ingested.
3. Create the data source: Remote data storage locations need to be registered as data sources.
4. Load the data: There are a few different ways to do this. The most straightforward way is to use the LOAD INTO command to ingest the data into a Kinetica cluster. Tables that are loaded in this manner are persisted on the cluster.

Combines a streaming second by milli-second view on portfolio holdings.

NOTE
: Even though we are looking at a static representation of portfolio holdings that is being combined with a streaming prices data, Kinetica can easily combine two different streaming data sources as well. This is possible even when the two data streams are being recorded on different timestamps (using ASOF joins).

SET UP AUTOMATED ALERTS
Now that we have the views created, we can set up alerts based on certain triggers. There are a few different ways to do it. We could set up a Kafka data sink that receives all new records from the portfolio alert table that we created in the previous sheet. We can use webhooks to setup alerts on applications like Slack etc.
CLONE, UNCOMMENT AND UPDATE
For this demo, we recommend using the website: https://webhook.site/ to generate a webhook URL. Clone this workbook to add the webhook URL as the destination in the stream below. This will send alerts to that URL any time the temperature value is greater than 60 for a particular truck. Uncomment the code below to try this on your own.
