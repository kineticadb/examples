We then use this graph network to find the optimal route between a source and destination point by picking the best charging station out of 268 different options. We repeat these computations every 5 seconds using a SQL procedure with new sets of source and destination points that are streaming in from a Kafka topic.","user_id":"a14c1650-2236-11ed-8a68-5194ba1cb631","warehouse_id":null,"is_example":false,"is_shared":false,"created_at":"2022-05-18T20:09:54.985Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T20:08:37.337Z","userId":"a14c1650-2236-11ed-8a68-5194ba1cb631"},"worksheets":[{"config":{},"id":"7f635b40-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","name":"Find the best route","description":"Description for Sheet 1","previous_worksheet_id":"806d0310-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","next_worksheet_id":"80a77400-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","workbook_id":"7f5f1580-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","created_at":"2022-05-18T20:09:55.071Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T20:08:39.607Z","workbookId":"7f5f1580-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85"},{"config":{},"id":"7fc0e490-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","name":"Data setup (DDL)","description":"Description for sheet 2","previous_worksheet_id":"803cf260-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","next_worksheet_id":"806d0310-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","workbook_id":"7f5f1580-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","created_at":"2022-05-19T15:22:08.530Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T20:08:39.623Z","workbookId":"7f5f1580-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85"},{"config":{},"id":"803cf260-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","name":"About this demo","description":"Description for sheet 4","previous_worksheet_id":null,"next_worksheet_id":"7fc0e490-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","workbook_id":"7f5f1580-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","created_at":"2022-05-24T15:42:53.327Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T20:08:39.639Z","workbookId":"7f5f1580-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85"},{"config":{},"id":"806d0310-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","name":"Create and explore the graph network","description":"Description for sheet 5","previous_worksheet_id":"7fc0e490-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","next_worksheet_id":"7f635b40-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","workbook_id":"7f5f1580-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","created_at":"2022-05-31T19:59:16.895Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T20:08:39.656Z","workbookId":"7f5f1580-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85"},{"config":{},"id":"80a77400-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","name":"❗️PAUSE SUBSCRIPTION","description":"Description for sheet 5","previous_worksheet_id":"7f635b40-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","next_worksheet_id":null,"workbook_id":"7f5f1580-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","created_at":"2022-06-02T14:58:52.838Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T20:08:39.672Z","workbookId":"7f5f1580-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85"}],"blockMap":{"7f635b40-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85":[{"config":{},"id":"7f688b60-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","name":"Block","description":"Description for Block","content":"{\"table_schema\":\"\",\"table_name\":\"optimal_route\",\"geometry_type\":\"wkt\",\"wkt\":\"wkt1\",\"renderType\":\"raster\",\"fillColor\":\"ca2c92\",\"borderColor\":\"32f958ff\",\"lineWidth\":6,\"center_longitude\":-83.858,\"center_latitude\":42.427,\"zoom_level\":9.1,\"opacity\":100,\"overrides\":[{\"name\":\"\",\"value\":\"\"}],\"auto_refresh_interval\":5,\"basemap_style\":\"color\"}","previous_block_id":"7f718c10-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","next_block_id":null,"block_type_id":"e8ccc4e2-793f-47ed-9af2-f0a58a840006","worksheet_id":"7f635b40-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","created_at":"2022-05-24T15:58:39.855Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T20:08:37.714Z","worksheetId":"7f635b40-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","blockTypeId":"e8ccc4e2-793f-47ed-9af2-f0a58a840006"},{"config":{},"id":"7f6d9470-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","name":"Block","description":"Description for Block","content":"[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"RUN THE SHORTEST PATH SOLVERS\",\"bold\":true}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Now that we have the graph representation of the road network we can run solvers against it.

Your car only has enough charge to travel an hour. To be on the safer side, you would like to find a charging station that is within 40 minutes from when you start before you get to your destination (irrespective of whether the destination is less than an hour away). Once charged, you would like to then proceed to your final destination.\"}]}]","previous_block_id":null,"next_block_id":"8047c7d0-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","block_type_id":"a9949a1a-14e3-11eb-adc1-0242ac120002","worksheet_id":"803cf260-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","created_at":"2022-05-26T14:20:05.490Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T20:08:39.074Z","worksheetId":"803cf260-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","blockTypeId":"a9949a1a-14e3-11eb-adc1-0242ac120002"},{"config":{},"id":"80597b10-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","name":"Block","description":"Description for Block","content":"{}","previous_block_id":"8050ef90-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","next_block_id":null,"block_type_id":"d7d34b22-2aa2-484f-9e8e-106f62612caf","worksheet_id":"803cf260-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","created_at":"2022-07-06T18:31:07.109Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T20:08:39.090Z","worksheetId":"803cf260-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","blockTypeId":"d7d34b22-2aa2-484f-9e8e-106f62612caf"}],"806d0310-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85":[{"config":{},"id":"8070fab0-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","name":"Block 1","description":"Description for Block 1","content":"\"CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTED GRAPH mm_lakes \\n(\\n    EDGES => INPUT_TABLE(\\n        SELECT  \\n            shape AS WKTLINE, \\n            direction AS DIRECTION,\\n            time AS WEIGHT_VALUESPECIFIED\\n        FROM mm_lakes_shape\\n    ),\\n    OPTIONS => KV_PAIRS(\\n        graph_table = 'mm_lakes_graph_table'\\n    )\\n);\"","previous_block_id":"80747d20-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","next_block_id":"80793810-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","block_type_id":"84b9233c-14e3-11eb-adc1-0242ac120002","worksheet_id":"806d0310-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","created_at":"2022-05-31T19:59:17.010Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T20:08:39.337Z","worksheetId":"806d0310-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","blockTypeId":"84b9233c-14e3-11eb-adc1-0242ac120002"},{"config":{},"id":"80747d20-44e9-11ed-8743-9909f6ef0c85","name":"Block","description":"Description for Block","content":"[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"CREATE THE GRAPH\",\"bold\":true}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Now that we have all the data we need for this example in tables in Kinetica we can start with the analytical tasks. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Our first task is to convert the road network into a graph representation.
