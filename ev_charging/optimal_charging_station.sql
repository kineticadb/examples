/* Workbook: Optimal Charging Station */
/* Workbook Description: You are in an electric car that is almost out of charge. 

In this demo, we use Kinetica’s graph API to create a 1.2 million node graph representation of the road network in and around Detroit. We then use this graph network to find the optimal route between a source and destination point by picking the best charging station out of 268 different options. We repeat these computations every 5 seconds using a SQL procedure with new sets of source and destination points that are streaming in from a Kafka topic. */

/*
FIND THE BEST ROUTE WITH A CHARGING PIT STOP
This workbook models the following scenario. You would like to go from a random source point to a random destination point in the Detroit region using an electric car.
However, you have a problem. Your car only has enough charge to travel an hour. To be on the safer side, you would like to find a charging station that is within 40 minutes from when you start before you get to your destination (irrespective of whether the destination is less than an hour away). Once charged, you would like to then proceed to your final destination.

/*
THE SOLUTION
We will use Kinetica's graph API to solve this problem. Kinetica provides a generic and extensible design of networks with the aim of being tailored or used for various real-life applications, such as transportation, utility, social, and geospatial. Here are the analytical steps.
1. Create the graph: Each road segment (edge) has an associated direction of travel (one-way, two-way), the time taken to travel (weight). We use this information to model the road network as a weighted directed graph.
2. Find the shortest path from the source to all electric vehicle (EV) charging stations that are within range (40 mins).
3. Find the inverse shortest path from all EV charging stations to the destination point.
4. Find the path from the source to destination via a charging station that has minimum cost.
USING KINETICA TO SOLVE HARDER PROBLEMS
We extend this use case further by adding a streaming component. Instead of running the shortest path solvers once, we use a streaming ingest from Kafka that sends out new source and destination points to run this calculation against new inputs every 5 seconds. Since Kinetica is a fully vectorized database, it can perform computationally challenging tasks even on lower end machines.

LOAD THE DATA FROM THE S3 DATA SOURCE INTO TABLES IN KINETICA
We will be loading data from two files that are on AWS S3.
1. The first table contains the road network data for the greater Michigan area. This is a large file that contains WKT linestrings for different road segments along with information on average speeds, time for traversal, direction etc.
2. The second table contains EV charging station locations in the greater Michigan area

✎ NOTE
: We are directly loading the files into tables without defining them in advance. Kinetica has an excellent type inferencing system that does a good job of inferring data types on the fly. In addition, the data that we are using for this example has a Kinetica compatible CSV header format that is used to define the table data.

2. Next we need to find the shortest path from the current destination to all the EV charging stations (inverse shortest path)

EXPLAINING THE SQL PROCEDURE AND SOLVERS
The SQL procedure below does all of the analytical work for this example. A SQL procedure is an executable batch of SQL statements that can be run either on schedule or on demand by the user.
The procedure below performs three steps.
1. Calculate the shortest path from the current source to all EV charging stations that are within 40 minutes (sometime this will yield no results because there aren't any charging stations within that radius from the current source point).
2. Calculate the inverse shortest path from all EV charging stations to the current destination.
3. Find the path from the source to a destination with an EV charging station stop that has the lowest combined weight.
The SQL procedure is run on a schedule of every 5 seconds. This means that every 5 seconds we find the most current source and destination point (from the Kafka topic ingest) and recompute the steps above based on these.
The maps below the procedure show the two shortest path routes (Source to EV and EV to destination) and the combined route with minimum cost. They are set to refresh every few seconds so that we see the most updated version of the output.
