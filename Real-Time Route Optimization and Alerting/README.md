<h1>
Real-Time Route Optimization and Alerting
</h1>

This workbook demonstrates the application of Kinetica's Multiple Supply Demand Chain Optimization (MSDO) solver with using a Kafka server to create <b>real-time tracking</b> scenario.
In this project phase, we will commence the tracking of GPS signals emitted by a fleet, subsequently conducting comprehensive data analysis based on the information received from the trucks.

## Background

Matching supply chain logistics to demand-based routing is a daily and non-trivial task, crucial for numerous companies like Amazon and Uber. The overarching goal is to optimize routing within specific industry constraints. Kinetica's MSDO solver offers a versatile solution applicable across various industries. Optimization objectives can range from distributing power by transformers to consumers with varying needs, transporting tons of gasoline to different stations, or delivering packets of goods from depots to multiple locations. What remains consistent in all these transport challenges is that both supply and demand quantities are not constant.

In this project phase, we initiate the tracking of GPS signals emitted by a fleet, followed by comprehensive data analysis based on the information received from the trucks. The project has been developed to emulate signals originating from a fleet of ten trucks, all adhering to routes defined by the optimal route solver's output. The signals are produced via the Kafka server and stream data into the workbook. The workbook introduces random delays to each truck's data when presenting real-time information about truck locations.

This SQL workbook showcases how to leverage Kinetica’s Multiple Supply Demand Optimization (MSDO) Graph Solver, a powerful tool designed for complex, real-time routing optimization. The workbook walks you through a scenario involving 30 customers and 21 trucks, originating from 13 supply depots in the Washington DC area. Unlike traditional solvers, the MSDO solver considers a multitude of constraints, such as package volume, truck capacity, and even real-time conditions, to find the optimal route for each truck. Real-time GPS data for simulated routes for each truck is streamed into Kinetica via Kafka, enabling immediate comparison and alerting for any significant deviations from the optimal routes.
The workbook is divided into three main sections:
- Data setup, where we prepare the data sources, tables, and a graph representation of the Washington DC road network;
- Optimal route calculation using the MSDO solver;
- Real-time monitoring and alerting for route deviations.
By the end of this workbook, you’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of how to implement sophisticated, real-time routing optimizations using Kinetica’s MSDO solver.
