A CLOSER LOOK AT THE DATA
Run the code above to see the first 5 rows of the road_weights data. The road weights data is a geo spatial dataset with data on the Seattle Road Network. The network is broken into small road segments with the following information for each segment.
1. OriginalEdgeID - Unique identifier for each road segment
2. TwoWay - 0 indicates one way and 1 indicates a two way edge
3. WKTLINE - The WKT Linestring that represents each road segment geo spatially.
4. time - This is the time that it would take to traverse each segment.

CREATING GRAPHS IN KINETICA
Graphs in Kinetica can have 4 components - nodes, edges, weights and restrictions. The primary task when creating a graph is to use the data at hand to accurately identify the required components for creating the graph.
The two videos below give a quick introduction to creating graphs in Kinetica

/*
PICKING THE IDENTIFIER COMBINATION FOR CREATING THE GRAPH
Based on the data that we have, we can create a weighted graph with direction.
- the edges are represented using WKT LINESTRINGs in the WKTLINE column of the seattle_road_network table (EDGE_WKTLINE). The road segments' directionality is derived from the TwoWay column of the seattle_road_network table (EDGE_DIRECTION).
- the weights are represented using the time taken to travel the segment found in the time column of the seattle_road_network table (WEIGHTS_VALUESPECIFIED). The weights are matched to the edges using the same WKTLINE column as edges (WEIGHTS_EDGE_WKTLINE) and the same TwoWay column as the edge direction (WEIGHTS_EDGE_DIRECTION).

The nodes for the graph are implicitly derived from the edges (as the starting and ending points of each edge). The restrictions component is empty since we are not restricting any of the nodes or edges for this example.

THREE ROUTES TO SOLVE
There are three different route combinations that we would like to solve.
1. One source to one destination
2. One souurce to many destinations
3. Many sources to many destination.

Kinetica supports the creation and execution of User Defined Functions in SQL (https://docs.kinetica.com/7.2/sql/udf/#sql-execute-function). SOLVE_GRAPH is a function that can be executed either within a SELECT statement as a table function or within an EXECUTE FUNCTION call (https://docs.kinetica.com/7.2/sql/graph/#sql-graph-solve).
We will use the latter.
Our source point is `POINT(-122.1792501 47.2113606)` and our destination point is `POINT(-122.2221 47.5707)`. Let's start by creating two tables - one that stores all the sources and another for the destinations.

MANY TO MANY
The third example illustrates a shortest path solve from two source nodes to four destination nodes. For this example, there are two starting points (POINT(-122.1792501 47.2113606) and POINT(-122.375180125237 47.8122103214264) and paths will be calculated from the first source to two different destinations and from the second source to two other destinations. When many source nodes and many destination nodes are provided, the graph solver pairs the source and destination node by list index and calculate a shortest path solve for each pair. So the first point in the solver list is paired with the first in the destination so on and so forth.

Let's add these additional values to the source table. Note that we don't need to update the destination table since it already contains the 4 destination nodes.
