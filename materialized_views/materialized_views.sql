SETUP THE DATA SOURCE

ABOUT THE DATA
The Kafka streams is setup to simulate a real time stream of ship locations over the last 2 days.

LOAD THE DATA
Next we define the table and start loading data from the kafka cluster. Kinetica starts by loading the first message in the topic (about 2 days old) till it catches up with the most recent message (i.e. the current location of ships).
The map below is set to refresh automatically once every 2 seconds, so you can see the tracks develop on the map as the data streams in.
⚠️
NOTE:
The data for the Kafka topic is generated using a seed file that contains about 4 days worth of Track data. So you might start seeing Tracks that are repeated if you keep Kinetica running for more than that period. This might yield unexpected results when analyzing Tracks.
