/*
This SQL workbook showcases how to leverage Kineticaâ€™s "match_batch" graph solver, a powerful tool designed for, optimal Origin-Destination(O-D) path calculation. This workbook walks you through a scenario involving 2 supply locations and 5 demand locations in the Washington DC area. The solver will calculate the most optimal O-D path between all supply and demand locations and provide the optimal path for each pair.
This analysis has the following steps:
Data Sheet:
- Load data sources
- Create and populate tables
- Create a graph representation of the Washington DC road network.
Batch Solve Sheet:
- Create OD pairs
- Run the "match_batch" solver
- Find the optimal path for each supply and demand location pairs.
- Understand the output of "match_batch" solver
HOW TO RUN?
All the steps and instructions are provided within the workbook itself.
To ensure successful execution of the workbook, it is essential to adhere to the prescribed order of blocks and sheets. We will create all the necessary data sources and download the required data into our workbook.

CREATE THE DATA SOURCES
We will be using a data source called "batch_tsm". This data source contains raw spatial data table.
Our first task is to register the data source so that we can connect to them.

IN THIS SHEET
In this sheet, we will create a new table that pairs the suppliers and demands locations. Next, we'll calculate the distances between each supplier and demand location to determine the optimal path connecting them using Kinetica's 'match_batch_solves' solver.
CREATE PAIRS TABLE
We are in the process of creating a new table called 'dc_pairs.' This table is designed to match two supply locations with all five demand locations, resulting in 10 different O-D pairs, each linked to a unique ID. Within each pair, there will be an origin (supplier location) and a destination (demand location). The 'dc_pairs' table will subsequently be utilized to compute the optimal cost(Time in Seconds) for each combination using Kinetica's 'match_batch_solves' solver.

/*
HOW DOES A MATCH BATCH SOLVER WORKS
A match batch solver takes the following inputs: a graph network and a pairs table of supply and demand locations. It uses these inputs to find the path with optimal cost for each pair in the table and provides the associated cost for each path.
SOLVER SPECIFICATION
In the 'solve_method' section, we opt for 'match_batch_solves,' indicating that our solver will find the optimal path for each combination in the match batch concept. The output of the solver is stored in the 'solution_table,' which is set to 'dc_shortest_path' in the following query.

OUTPUT OF THE MATCH BATCH SOLVE
It's important to familiarize ourselves with the solver's output. Run the block below to see the output, which consists of five distinct columns, each serving a specific purpose.
- The 'index' column indicates the unique identification for each path.
- The 'source' column provides coordinates for the starting location of a path.
- The 'target' column provides coordinates for the destination location of a path.
- The 'cost' column shows the total path cost, in this case, in seconds.
- The 'path' column displays the route's tracks.
