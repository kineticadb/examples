# ðŸ“˜ Enriching Graphs with Vector Similarity in Kinetica

This workbook demonstrates how to combine vector similarity with graph semantics to create a richer, more intelligent knowledge graphâ€”one that can answer complex questions with simple queries. It replicates the use case detailed in our blog post where movie preference vectors are used to add meaningful, similarity-based edges to a demographic graph.

# ðŸ§  What This Demonstrates

Traditional graphs are great for modeling relationships, but the connections donâ€™t always capture semantic meaning. Similarly, vector embeddings can capture affinities, but they often flatten structure and miss long-range dependencies. This example shows how to inject vector similarities directly into a graph to combine the strengths of both approaches.

Key concepts demonstrated:

- Using movie-genre vectors to compute similarity between individuals
- Creating new graph edges based on vector thresholds
- Executing multi-hop queries that combine demographic and similarity-based paths
- Leveraging Kineticaâ€™s hybrid OLAP + Graph + Vector SQL engine


# Try it yourself
All the steps and instructions are provided within the workbook itself. All you need to do is follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/kineticadb/examples#how-to-run-these-examples) to load the workbook into Kinetica and try this out on your own.
