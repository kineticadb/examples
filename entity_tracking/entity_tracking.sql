THE PROBLEM
Let's say you work for the US Coast Guard Service in the Gulf of Mexico region. Your job is to monitor ship traffic in the area to alert whenever the following events happen.
-- When a ship enters certain areas within the Gulf of Mexico region
-- Identify which ships are dwelling or loitering (not moving) within this area of interest
-- When ships are passing too close to other ships (proximity alerts)

Next we define the table and start loading data from the kafka cluster. Kinetica starts by loading the first message in the topic (about 2 days old) till it catches up with the most recent message (i.e. the current location of ships).
The map below is set to refresh automatically once every 2 seconds, so you can see the tracks develop on the map as the data streams in.
⚠️
NOTE:
The data for the Kafka topic is generated using a seed file that contains about 4 days worth of Track data. So you might start seeing Tracks that are repeated if you keep Kinetica running for more than that period. This might yield unexpected results when analyzing Tracks.

/*
WHAT ARE TRACKS?
A track is a
native
geospatial object in Kinetica that is used to represent the path an object takes over time and space. A track is defined using an ID, x and y coordinates and timestamps.
WHY ARE TRACKS USEFUL?
Pretty much any object that moves can be represented and studied using tracks. This has a wide range of application in almost all sectors of the economy including supply chain management, ride sharing, and IoT devices.
WHAT SETS KINETICA APART?
Tracks are unique to Kinetica and they are represented as a native geospatial object in the database. There are several advantages to this:
-- When a track is defined, Kinetica, automatically interpolates between the points to construct the path that constitutes the track.
-- This interpolation to a path allows Kinetica to perform geospatial operations that detect intersections, collisions, proximity with other geospatial objects and measure track features such as its length and duration.
All of this out of the box functionality makes it easier and more performant to use Kinetica to analyze the behaviour of tracks without having to write any custom code yourself.

CREATE AN ALERT
The materialized view that was setup earlier does all the work of monitoring the incoming data to automatically detect anytime a track intersects with our geofence. Now all we need to do is to direct that information out of Kinetica so that the end user is alerted as soon an event of interest occurs.
There are a few different ways to do this. We could set up a Kafka topic or apps like Slack as a data sink that receives alerts. Or we can use a simple webhook to send the alerts and then process data from the webhook in downstream apps.
SEE EVENTS BEING STREAMED IN REAL TIME
For this illustration, we will use the latter to send records to a pipedream webhook and then hook that up to the following google spreadsheet:

DWELLING VS LOITERING
Dwelling is when a object is almost entirely stationary. For instance, a ship that has dropped anchor will barely move until it lifts its anchor. So we'd expect the track length and the area that it covers to be pretty small for the period that it is dwelling.
Loitering on the other hand is when an object is constantly moving but within a small area. So in the case of dwelling, we'd expect the track length to be significantly greater than zero but the area that it covers (based on the bounds) to be pretty small. Loitering in this context could mean a ship which is performing a particular kind of activity like fishing.
Let's start by finding all the ships that are dwelling. Our threshold for dwelling is an bounds area less than 100 metre squared and a track length less than 100 metres total over the last 4 hours.

SET UP AN ALERT
Go ahead and clone this example to your workspace if you are running this on read only mode (example) to complete the next steps.
In the previous worksheet we set up an alert by first setting up a Data Sink that was configured to send messages to a Slack channel. Follow the instructions here to set up a slack app and use that to send messages to a channel on you workspace whenever dwelling or loitering ships are identified.. https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks.
If you don't have access to Slack, you can follow the instructions from one of other examples to set up an alerting system via webhook . Try the "Time Series Joins With ASOF" example.
