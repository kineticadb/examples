# Python Examples

In this repository you will find notebooks with examples demonstrating Kinetica functionality.

## Prerequisites

You will need an installation of Kinetica to run these notebooks. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.kinetica.com/try/) to install the free developer edition of Kinetica or those [here](https://www.kinetica.com/platform/azure/) to deploy Kinetica as a managed service in the cloud.

Need help getting started with notebooks? You have a number of options and this is far from a complete list:

* [Classic Jupyter server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html): Launch a standalone notbook server.

* [JupyterLab server](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/overview.html): A more sophisticated web based IDE that replaces the classic interface.

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/11/08/custom-notebooks): Use this if you prefer a locally installed application.

* [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/docs): This is one of many options if you want to run a notebook in the cloud.


## Summary of Notebook Guides

* [Python Developer Guide](python_dev_guide.ipynb): This guide provides step-by-step instructions to get started writing Python applications using Kinetica. It demonstrates only a small set of the available API. A more detailed description of the complete interface is available under [Python API Reference](https://docs.kinetica.com/7.1/api/python/).

* [Vector Dataframe I/O Demo](python_vector_io.ipynb): We will learn ingress and egress of records with vector columns. This includes loading data a CSV to a dataframe and using a dataframe to create a Kinetica table.

* [Vector Similarity Search Demo](python_vector_search.ipynb): Learn how to use the Kinetica similarity search with the vector column type to make stock predictions. We will finish with a matplotlib visualization of the results.

* [Using GPUdbSqlIterator and GPUdbIngestor](python_iterator_ingestor.ipynb): Learn about using GPUdbSqlIterator for conveniently retrieving large result sets and GPUdbIngestor for multi-head ingest.
