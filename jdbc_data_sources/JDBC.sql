WHAT IS JDBC?
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is a standardized API for interacting with databases using Java programs. Kinetica offers a data source that can be used to connect to other databases and applications using a JDBC driver. We can then issue remote queries to this data source to load and export data to and from Kinetica into this data source.
CDATA
Kinetica has also partnered with CData, a data connectivity platform that offers JDBC drivers for hundreds of different databases and applications.
TWO ROUTES
There are two ways to register a JDBC data source. You can either Bring Your Own Driver (BYOD), or you can use a driver provided by CData.
THIS DEMO
In this demo, we explore both the BYOD and CData routes. First, we will use a CData driver to load data from Google Sheets into Kinetica, and then we will bring our own JDBC driver to connect to a Postgres database.

/*
WHAT IS A SCHEMA?
Schemas are logical containers for most database objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.), grouped together under a common name. In order to place an object in a schema, the schema must be created first—schemas will not be automatically created when specified in CREATE TABLE or similar calls.
CREATE A NEW SCHEMA
We will use the 'jdbc' schema to organize the tables and data objects for this example.
*/
/* TEXT Block End */


/* SQL Block Start */
-- Create the schema
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS jdbc;
/* SQL Block End */


/* TEXT Block Start */
/*
CREATE THE DATA SOURCE
Paste the authorization code that you generated (see prerequisites) earlier as the value for OAuthVerifier in the query below (LOCATION parameter).
✎
Note
: The CDATA connector is specified separately for each spreadsheet.
*/
/* TEXT Block End */


/* SQL Block Start */
-- Create the JDBC data source that points to the 'nyct2010' Google Spreadsheet
CREATE OR REPLACE DATA SOURCE jdbc.gsheets
LOCATION = 'jdbc:cdata:googlesheets:OAuthVerifier=PASTE YOUR AUTH CODE HERE;InitiateOAuth=REFRESH;Spreadsheet=nyct2010';
/* SQL Block End */


/* TEXT Block Start */
/*
CREATE THE TABLE
While Kinetica has a good type inferencing system, it is always a best practice to define the table schema before loading data into it.
*/
/* TEXT Block End */


/* SQL Block Start */
CREATE MATERIALIZED EXTERNAL TABLE "jdbc"."nyct2010"
(
    "id" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "gid" INTEGER (primary_key) NOT NULL,
    "geom" GEOMETRY,
    "CTLabel" VARCHAR (16),
    "BoroCode" VARCHAR (16),
    "BoroName" VARCHAR (16),
    "CT2010" VARCHAR (16),
    "BoroCT2010" VARCHAR (16),

    "PUMA" VARCHAR (16),
    "Shape_Leng" DOUBLE,
    "Shape_Area" DOUBLE
);

/*
LOAD THE DATA
Data is loaded by issuing a query to the remote data source.
✎ Note:
The googlesheets API uses the syntax 'spreadsheet_sheetName' to identify the sheet from which to load the data.

/* SQL Block Start */

WHAR IS POSTGRES DATABASE
Postgres is a very popular open-source relational database management system. The worksheets shows how to connect to an instance of Postgres using JDBC.
*/
/* TEXT Block End */


/* TEXT Block Start */
/*
CREATE THE DATA SOURCE
The credential for accessing the PostgreSQL database (if using the docker version in pre-reqs) is 'postgres'. Make sure the PostgreSQL database is up and running before registering the data source.
✎ Note
: The data source is registered for 'dellstore'. You can try replacing it with other datasets.

LOAD DATA
In the query below, we use Kinetica's type inferencing system to directly load the data from PostgreSQL into a table without having created the table in Kinetica first.
