This workbook demonstrates a wide range of time series capabilities with Kinetica.
1. Real time data feeds: Load and analyze data from real time feeds
2. Date time functions: Manipulate data time objects and explore time buckets.
3. Window functions: Use window functions to calculate common time series indicators like moving average, cumulative sums and ranks.
4. ASOF Joins: Perform interval based inexact joins that combine two data feeds with differing time stamp values. 
5. Alerting: Trigger/stream downstream alerts based on continuosly maintained materialized views in Kinetica

## Write once, do forever
All of the analsis in the workbook is done on real time data feeds that are continuously updated. Once set up, Kinetica will keep all the queries updated automatically.

## About the data
We have set up two synthetic Kafka topics for this demonstration.

1. Trades topic: The trades topic records intraday trades data on a per-minute basis. This data includes the open, close, low and high price, and the traded volumes every minute for three stocks — Apple, Amazon and Google.
2. Quotes topic: The quotes data is produced at the rate of five to six messages per second. This records the bid price, bid size, ask price and ask size for the three stocks.

The topics are set up to mimic market feeds but the information in the topics don’t reflect actual prices right now. Another point to note is that actual market feeds are operational only during market hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or extended hours), however, the topics that I have set up produce data continuously so that the code works regardless of the time zone you are in.
