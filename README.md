# Welcome
This repo contains three types of content - 
1. Demos: Solve real world challenges with real world data.
2. Guides: Explore specific features of Kinetica using real or fake data.
3. Labs: Learn concepts and features through labs

All the content is meant to be fully reproducible so that anyone who wants to replicate can do so using Kinetica.

### Getting Started


# Catalog

### 1. Quick Start Workbook
Start your journey with a guided tour of Kinetica's analytics and visualization. Create data sources, ingest data from Amazon S3 and Kafka, then perform location analytics and visualize results on a map. Follow-along with Kinetica's [Quick Start Workbook](https://docs.kinetica.com/7.1/azure/guides/quick-start-workbook/) guide on available on Kinetica's documentation site.

### 2. Windmill Optimization
Use Kinetica's UDF capability to predict the power output of windmills in North America. Create data sources, ingest data from Azure Blob and Kafka, create and run a Python-based linear regression UDF, then visualize the power output on a map.
