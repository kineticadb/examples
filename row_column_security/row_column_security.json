In order to place an object in a schema, the schema must be created first—schemas will not be automatically created when specified in CREATE TABLE or similar calls.\n<b>CREATE A NEW SCHEMA</b>\nWe will be creating a new schema called 'OurCo' to store all the employee and salary tables. Before we start creating the schema, we need to make sure there is no schema in our database with the same name.\nThe code below drops any existing occurrences of the OurCo schema. A schema can only be dropped if there are no tables in it. Setting the 'CASCADE' option to true will drop the tables in a schema first and then drop the schema as well.\n❗️<b>NOTE</b>: The drop schema command will remove any previously created tables within the OurCo schema. You can either rename the schema or move the current tables to a different schema to prevent them from being lost.\nYou can read more about Schemas here: <u><a href=\"https://docs.kinetica.com/7.1/sql/ddl/#create-schema\">https://docs.kinetica.com/7.1/sql/ddl/#create-schema</a></u>"},"id":"a731fdc0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da","name":"HTML Visualization","description":"Description for html visualization","block_id":"a72f3ea0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da","visualization_type_id":"757cd7cb-6f08-4416-9e9a-291cd651246f","created_at":"2024-01-15T13:16:06.739Z","updated_at":"2024-02-07T09:52:49.565Z","blockId":"a72f3ea0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da","visualizationTypeId":"757cd7cb-6f08-4416-9e9a-291cd651246f"}],"a7500d10-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a752a520-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a7556440-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a757fc50-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a75abb70-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a75d5380-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a75feb90-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a762f8d0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a7660610-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a7689e20-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a76b0f20-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a76da730-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a78db250-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a7907170-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a7930980-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a795c8a0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a79b6df0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a79fb3b0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a7a46ea0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a7a950a0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a7bf2290-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[{"config":{"image_url":"https://lapaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Data-Security-in-your-Team-980x551-1.jpg","height":"","width":"700","alignment":"center","title":""},"id":"a7c1baa0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da","name":"Image Visualization","description":"Description for image visualization","block_id":"a7bf2290-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da","visualization_type_id":"61ec39b0-3295-4354-b92c-831fec4dacb3","created_at":"2023-12-11T02:49:31.165Z","updated_at":"2024-02-07T09:52:50.506Z","blockId":"a7bf2290-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da","visualizationTypeId":"61ec39b0-3295-4354-b92c-831fec4dacb3"}],"a7c479c0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a7c75ff0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a82389b0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a8266fe0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a829a430-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a82c8a60-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a82f2270-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a83208a0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a834c7c0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"a8375fd0-c59e-11ee-8a9e-39fce638e4da":[],"3f237320-c76b-11ee-bcfb-f51a92dbdee4":[],"3f354d70-c76b-11ee-bcfb-f51a92dbdee4":[],"3f4e7ac0-c76b-11ee-bcfb-f51a92dbdee4":[],"3f681d40-c76b-11ee-bcfb-f51a92dbdee4":[],"3f808740-c76b-11ee-bcfb-f51a92dbdee4":[{"config":{"html_source":"We applied some filters to 'engineering' role, so this role should not access to all data in 'employees' and 'salaries' tables.
