HOW TO PROVIDE DATA SECURITY IN AN ORGANIZAGTION?
This SQL workbook showcases how to provide data security within an organization using Kinetica. The workbook walks you through a scenario involving a company called 'OurCo' and we create roles and assign our users (employees) into these roles. Each role is strategically configured with specific permissions, ensuring that users only access relevant data crucial to their responsibilities. Leveraging Kinetica's table security features, unnecessary data is safeguarded from unauthorized access.
The workbook is divided into four main sections:
- Data setup, where we prepare and populate our tables.
- Creating roles for our organization.
-Creating users and assigning them to their respective roles.
- Granting permissions to each roles, guaranteeing controlled and secure data access.
HOW TO RUN?
All the steps and instructions are provided within the workbook itself.
To ensure successful execution of the workbook, it is essential to adhere to the prescribed order of blocks and sheets. We will create all the necessary data sources and download the required data into our workbook. When prompted in the workbook, log out from the admin account and sign in as other users to test security functionalities.

/*
WHAT IS A SCHEMA?
Schemas are logical containers for most database objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.), grouped together under a common name. In order to place an object in a schema, the schema must be created first‚Äîschemas will not be automatically created when specified in CREATE TABLE or similar calls.
CREATE A NEW SCHEMA
We will be creating a new schema called 'OurCo' to store all the employee and salary tables. Before we start creating the schema, we need to make sure there is no schema in our database with the same name.
The code below drops any existing occurrences of the OurCo schema. A schema can only be dropped if there are no tables in it. Setting the 'CASCADE' option to true will drop the tables in a schema first and then drop the schema as well.
‚ùóÔ∏è NOTE:
The drop schema command will remove any previously created tables with in the OurCo schema. You can either rename the schema or move the current tables to a different schema to prevent them from being lost.
You can read more about Schemas here:
https://docs.kinetica.com/7.1/sql/ddl/#create-schema

WHAT IS A ROLE?
A role is a container for permissions. It simplifies the process of managing access control by grouping related permissions together.
Roles are particularly useful in scenarios where multiple users need similar levels of access to various database objects, such as tables, files and folders within Kinetica.
You can read more about role management here:

/*
WHAT IS A USER?
A user is an account that can connect to a database and perform operations, such as querying, modifying data, and executing stored procedures. Users are associated with specific permissions and access rights, defining their level of interaction with the database.
For now, we will assign only two of our employees to user accounts. These employees are Harry and Bjones. Harry will be assigned to the Human Resources role, and Bjones will be assigned to the Engineering role.

1. Try logging out and logging back in using the newly created users harry.
2. Once you log in you will notice that the schema OurCo or the HR folder that were created the "Create Schema and Directory" sheet are not present for these two users. This is because we haven't given them access yet. We will do so in the next sheet.
3. Repeat 1 & 2 for bjones.

/*
GRANTING PERMISSIONS TO A ROLE
In Kinetica, granting permissions to a role involves assigning specific privileges to the role so that any user assigned to that role inherits those permissions. This simplifies access management, as changes to permissions can be made at the role level rather than for each individual user.
You can read more about managing permissions (privileges) here:
https://docs.kinetica.com/7.1/sql/security/#privilege-management

2. Load the CSV files into HR folder: Now that you the HR role has full access to the HR folder, you can use that to upload the the employees.csv file and the salaries.csv file. Go ahead and do that.
3. Once the files are in the HR folder they can be loaded into a OurCo.Employees and OurCo.Salaries tables that were defined in the first sheet. Use the import wizard to do that.

/*
COLUMN SECURITY FOR ENGINEERING
We want the Engineering team to only access the first name, last name, a hash of the cell phone, and the last 4 digits of the SSN. To achieve these security goals, we can use 'HASH' and 'MASK' functions. In Kinetica, these functions are a handy way to obfuscate or hide sensitive information.
WHAT IS HASH FUNCTION?
In Kinetica, a hash function is a mathematical algorithm that transforms input data into a fixed-size string of characters, typically a hash code.
WHAT IS MASK FUNCTION?
In Kinetica, a mask function is a mechanism that helps conceal sensitive data during query results by transforming it into a masked format.

/*
ROW SECURITY
We can also use WHERE clauses to restrict the rows that a user can see. For instance, you can restrict access to salary by setting the user id to who ever is the current user. This would only show the rows where the user id in the salaries table corresponds to the username of the current user.
